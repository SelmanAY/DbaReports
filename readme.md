# About Repository

These are my reports about security and performance monitoring (Using Adam Machanic's sp_WhoIsActive)

For performance reports I have used SQL Server Agent jobs to collect and aggregate data, SSRS for generated reports and [Visual Cron][1].
For security reports I have used only SSRS, reports are manually gathered by security department on demand.
